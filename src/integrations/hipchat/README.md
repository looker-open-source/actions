# Hipchat

This integration will send a data file to a Hipchat room using the credentials of the user account that enables an API Key. We recommend creating a LookerBot Hipchat user so that the source of a file is clear but the integration can work with any user.

1. Create an API key for your LookerBot user in your Hipchat console https://hipchat.com/account/api

2. Enable Hipchat in your looker Administration page for integrations (/admin/integrations).
