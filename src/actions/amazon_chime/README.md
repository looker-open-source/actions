## Send markdown tables from Looker queries to Amazon Chime via webhooks.
Take a Looker explore or look, and send the data to Amazon Chime through its [webhook integration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/ug/webhooks.html). You can send data to team members or create real time alerts as data is being analyzed in Looker.

## Chime Table Features

 - Takes the table visualization from a Look or Explore and creates a markdown table to send to Amazon Chime
 - Amazon Chime has a 4kb payload limit, so if there is too much data, this action will only send data that will fit in that payload.
 - Given this limit, the table may be truncated, in which case this action will give you the number of rows shown versus action and give you a link to see the data in Looker
 - Drill links may also be exposed while sending the table. When scheduling the Chime Action, you can choose if you want to include all, the first, or no drill links. This will affect the size of the payload and how much data you can send to Amazon Chime
 - The Title can also be sent as part of the integration; this will also include a link back to the original Looker / query in Looker
