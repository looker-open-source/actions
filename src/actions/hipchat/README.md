# Hipchat
## Send a message to a Hipchat room referencing data.

This action will send a data file to a Hipchat room using the credentials of the user account that enables an API Key. We recommend creating a LookerBot Hipchat user so that the source of a file is clear but the action can work with any user.

1. Create an API key for your LookerBot user in your [Hipchat console](https://hipchat.com/account/api).

2. Enable Hipchat in your looker Administration page for actions (/admin/actions).
