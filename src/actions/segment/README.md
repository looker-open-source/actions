# Segment
## Add traits to your Segment users.

The Segment action allows you to Identify users (tagged with either `email`, `user_id` or `segment_anonymous_id`) with additional fields via the Segment API. See this [discourse article](https://discourse.looker.com/t/looker-integrations-segment/5420) for implementation details.
