# Segment
## Add traits to your Segment users.

The Segment action allows you to Identify users (tagged with either `email`, `user_id` or `segment_anonymous_id`) with additional fields via the Segment API. See this [Looker Help Center article](https://help.looker.com/hc/en-us/articles/360023736413) for implementation details.
