# JIRA
## Create a JIRA issue referencing data

This action will create a JIRA Issue referencing data from a Look. You will first create a LookerBot user so that the creator of an issue is clear. You will then be able to create issues in any JIRA project that the LookerBot has access to referencing a Look.

1. Create a lookerbot user in your JIRA user [administration console](https://MYJIRA.atlassian.net/admin/users). Take note of the username and password you give to the lookerbot.

2. Enable JIRA in your looker Administration page for actions (/admin/actions).

* Address is the url of your JIRA server: e.g. https://MYJIRA.atlassian.net
* username of the lookerbot user
* password of the lookerbot user
