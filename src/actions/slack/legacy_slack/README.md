# Slack Attachment (API Token)

Perform this action to post an attachment with your Looker data to a public or private Slack channel or to a direct message (DM).

To use this action, you'll create an action app in the [api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com) interface that is tied to your Slack workspace and then configure a bot user from which the action will post the attachments by using the appropriate API token for that "user."

## Generating a Bot User Token in a Private Slack Action Application

1. Go to the Slack API app page at [https://api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com/apps).

2. Click **Create New App**. Enter a name for your app in the **App Name** field and select your company's Slack workspace from the **Development Slack Workspace** drop-down.

3. Once the app is created, click on the name of your app to open a page that allows you to further customize your app. Make sure your action app is selected in the drop-down in the upper left corner. 

4. Click the **App Home** tab in the sidebar. Click **Review Scopes to Add** to configure the scopes for your action app's bot token. (According to the Slack documentation, a [bot user token](https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types#bot) represents a bot associated with the app installed in a workspace. New bot users can request individual scopes, similar to user tokens. Unlike user tokens, bot user tokens are not tied to a user's identity; they're just tied to your app.)

5. On the **Oauth & Permissions** tab, scroll down to the **Scopes** section. Under **Bot Token Scopes**, click **Add an OAuth Scope**.

From the drop-down of OAuth scopes, select:
    
    * `channels:read`
    * `users:read`
    * `files:write`
    * `groups:read`
    * `im:read`
    * `mpim:read`
    * `chat:write`
